GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --credentials-file value, --cred-file value  Filepath at which to read/write the tunnel credentials [$TUNNEL_CRED_FILE]
   --region value                               Cloudflare Edge region to connect to. Omit or set to empty to connect to the global region. [$TUNNEL_REGION]
   --edge-ip-version value                      Cloudflare Edge IP address version to connect with. {4, 6, auto} (default: "4") [$TUNNEL_EDGE_IP_VERSION]

   --label value                                Use this option to give a meaningful label to a specific connector. When a tunnel starts up, a connector id unique to the tunnel is generated. This is a uuid. To make it easier to identify a connector, we will use the hostname of the machine the tunnel is running on along with the connector ID. This option exists if one wants to have more control over what their individual connectors are called.
